// Single Railway service (CLAUDE.md): apps/api and apps/worker run as two
// processes in the same container, started from here rather than from the
// Dockerfile CMD directly, because a container has exactly one PID 1 and
// only PID 1 receives SIGTERM from the platform. Each service is spawned by
// invoking its local tsx binary directly (not "pnpm --filter ... run start")
// so this script is the immediate parent of the real process — no shell or
// pnpm layer in between that could swallow or fail to forward the signal.
//
// The worker's recoverStaleJobs() (packages/core/src/jobs/) depends on the
// worker actually getting a chance to be told to stop rather than being
// killed outright: SIGTERM here is forwarded to both children and this
// script waits for both to exit before exiting itself, so a redeploy is a
// real shutdown, not a SIGKILL race.
